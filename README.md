# Video Object Detection and Speaker Count

This script uses OpenCV to detect faces in a video and estimate the number of speakers based on audio analysis. It demonstrates how to integrate face detection, audio processing, and speaker estimation in a video.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyDub (for audio processing)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Replace `video_path` with the path to your video file in the `main()` function.

3. Run the script using the following command:




The script will display the video with rectangles around detected faces and print the number of detected faces and estimated speakers in each frame.

## Functionality

- The script uses the Haarcascade classifier from OpenCV to detect faces in each frame of the video.

- The `detect_speakers` function estimates the number of speakers based on audio analysis. This implementation is a placeholder and can be replaced with more advanced techniques for accurate speaker detection.

## Notes

- Make sure the required video file is present at the specified path (`video_path`).

- The current implementation of `detect_speakers` is basic and may not provide accurate speaker estimates. Consider implementing more sophisticated audio analysis techniques for accurate results.

- If you encounter issues related to GUI support, refer to the documentation for troubleshooting or consider using a headless version of OpenCV for image display.

- Feel free to customize the code for your specific requirements or integrate more advanced face detection and speaker estimation models.
