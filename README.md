# OpenCV Video Processing with Maximized Window

This Python script demonstrates video processing using the OpenCV library. It reads a video file, detects faces in each frame using a pre-trained Haarcascade classifier, and displays the video with detected faces along with the number of detected faces and placeholder information for speakers. The script also resizes the video frame to 60% of its original size and maximizes the display window for better visualization.

## Features

- Reads video from a specified path.
- Detects faces in each frame using a Haarcascade classifier.
- Displays the video frames with detected faces.
- Calculates the number of detected faces and displays placeholder information for speakers.
- Resizes each frame to 60% of its original size for better viewing.
- Maximizes the display window for fullscreen visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. Clone or download this repository.

3. Replace `'sample1.mp4'` in the `video_path` variable with the path to your video file.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. A window will appear showing the video frames with detected faces. The window will be maximized to fullscreen mode to improve visibility.

## Notes

- This example employs placeholder functions for detecting speakers and their count. Replace these functions with actual audio processing logic if required.

## Results

Upon running the script, you will observe the following:

- The script will load the specified video file and process each frame.
- Detected faces within each frame will be highlighted with rectangles.
- The number of detected faces will be displayed on each frame.
- Placeholder information for the number of speakers will also be shown.
- Each video frame will be resized to 60% of its original size for better viewing.
- The display window will be maximized to fullscreen mode.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
